# FidelityFusion_Models Modules
In this section, we provide the code for the models used in our library.

## Supported models
### 1. AR (AutoRegression)
The method can be found in the following paper
[Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2673557)
### 2. ResGP(Residual Gaussian Process)
The method can be found in the following paper
[Residual Gaussian process: A tractable nonparametric Bayesian emulator for multi-fidelity simulations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0307904X21001724)

### 3. CAR (Continue Autoregression)
